# Meeter

A platform for meeting other students with similar interests. 

## Methodology 

Users have to enter general information about themselves. The algorithm will then process those inputs with keyword-based matching. The degree and general interests (in relation to the overlap) each account for 50% of the score. Finally, the three highest scoring other users will be presented to each user.
